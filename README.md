### Hi there 👋

I am [Ashish](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashishnerkar/), an Enthusiast Software Developer. I have previously worked on Windows based applications but now I am discovering new passion for web technologies 🕸
I like coding, constantly learning and sharing new things. For starters, I have created a repository for Design Patterns which I have come across and implemented.
[Check it out](https://github.com/ashishnkr/DesignPatterns)

Previously, I use to host all my code on VSTS (Now called Azure DevOps). I have migrated all that [here](https://github.com/ashishnkr/FromAzureDevOps). A good quick reference for programmers.
